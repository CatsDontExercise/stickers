# Laptop Stickers

These are stickers. Most are either existing jokes or joke versions of logos. I (@mikemaccana) might have printed them out for you and gave them to you at some event somewhere.

The MongoDB joke is @slexaxtons, I just licensed the right font and did the artwork. The horse.js belongs to @horse_js, I just found a higher res image of the mask and recreated it the image in higher res. The rest are from @mikemaccana.

If you like them, please:

 - Print them and give them away.
 - Give me credit for making them (maybe a link to me or this repo) if you show them off on social media.
 - Feel free to remix or whatever - most are joke versions of existing logos, go nuts.
